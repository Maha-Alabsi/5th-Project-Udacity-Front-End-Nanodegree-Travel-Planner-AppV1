# Travel Planner -Capstone project
***
**This project was developed as a last assignment while learning the Udacity-
Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.**

# About:
***
This project requires to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

# Description:
***
This project includes a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. I use 3 APIs ; [Weatherbit API] to get weather data but it has one problem, it only takes in coordinates for weather data -- itâ€™s that specific. So, I used a [Geonames API] to get those coordinates. Once I have all of this data, I displayed an image of the location entered by using the [Pixabay API].
